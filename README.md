# Color Logic Puzzle

This started out as an interesting whiteboarding problem at my first coding interview. I thought it would be a fun time to make it, so I did!

# How it works

You can visit the demo of the app here: https://szaf-color-logic-puzzle.herokuapp.com/

Click one of the squares at the bottom of the game grid to change the color of the top-left square. If the color of the square (before changing it) matches any neighbors of that square, it will change ALL adjacently connected squares to the new color. Neat!

Additional features to add next:

* adding tests
* a reset button
* number of moves tracker
* a way to adjust the height/width of the game board
* a way to adjust the number of colors
